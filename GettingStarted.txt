This document will cover the steps needed to order parts and assemble the sensor. 
	
While this repository includes the source code and other documents, not all the files are needed. For copy/paste assembly, these are the files needed for ordering parts, printing the PCB, setting up the Arduino code, and installing the app:
	1. Arduino/BreathingSensorNanoEveryWithTrigger/BreathingSensorNanoEveryWithTrigger.ino
	2. BreathingSensorParts_v3.xlsx
	3. PCB/v3/BreathingSensorWithTriggerV3.zip
	4. BreathingSensorWithTrigger.exe
