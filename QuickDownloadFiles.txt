This document will cover the documents needed to order parts and assemble the sensor. 
	
While this repository includes the source code and other documents, not all the files are needed. For copy/paste or fast assembly, these are the files needed for ordering parts, printing the PCB, setting up the Arduino code, printing the housing, and installing the app:
	1. Respiratory Sensor Parts List v3.xlsx
	2. PCB/v3/BreathingSensorWithTriggerV3.zip
		a. PCB/v3/BreathingSensorWithTriggerV3_BOM.xlsx (optional for assembly services)
	3. Arduino/BreathingSensorNanoEveryWithTrigger/BreathingSensorNanoEveryWithTrigger.ino
	4. STL/Housing.stl and STL/Lid.stl
	5. BreathingSensorWithTrigger.exe
